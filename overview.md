Sonic Pi 2 is an introductory open-source programming environment,
designed to teach code through the creation of sounds. Not only does it
allow you to compose pieces of music by writing code, it allows you to
perform music by changing the code on-the-fly an approach often referred
to as *live coding*.

Sonic Pi was developed by [Dr Sam Aaron](http://sam.aaron.name/) at the
University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. He uses the software to
perform live with his band. This resource will help get you started with
the basics of Sonic Pi 2 so that you can code your own music.
